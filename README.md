A small personal project to learn C.  

Inspired by the Rust guide to make a NES emulator. Source: https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html

# TODO  

Write tests (and subsequently remove the tests dir from the .gitignore file).  

Possibly make my own testing framework.  

Use Makefile to save object files in their own directory.  

Possibly put header files into a separate directory.
