A small personal project to learn C.  

Inspired by the Rust guide to make a NES emulator. Source: https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html

# TODO  

Write tests (and subsequently remove the tests dir from the .gitignore file).  

Make my own testing framework.  
    Macros for testing
    Makefile command to test automatically

Possibly put header files into a separate directory.
